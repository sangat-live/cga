Chandigarh Gatka Association (Regd.) is doing efforts to Promote Gatka as a
Sports under the ageis of National Gatka Association of India (Regd.).
This irony of fate that Gatka have been denied its due status and
recognition but on the contrary several games, which even had not
Indian origin and lesser known games, have already been included
in the schedule of National sports and University Games calendar.
Gatka sport must be included into the gradation list of general
sports so that Gatka players could also avail the benefits being
provided to the sportspersons. "Promotion of Gatka as a global sport
would certainly project India as the world's largest democracy committed
to secularism and unity in diversity,. It is mentioned here that it is a
style of fighting only with sticks between two Gatka players, intended to
simulate the sword and focuses on infusing physical, spiritual and mental
fitness. No sharp edged weapons are used in the transformed Gatka game.
The present martial art form, Gatka, has been acknowledged as a sport and
being played in the entire country and diaspora.
