The Gatka Federation of India (Regd.), for the first time, formulated and standardized the 
in-depth rules and regulations for playing of Gatka game and providing training to the 
budding Gatkebaaz through workshops, seminars and camps under the new Gatka rules.
We are pleased to inform you that Chandigarh Gatka Association (CGA)
has already affiliated the Chandigarh Olympic Association  (COA).
The Department of Education, Chandigarh has also incorporated the 
Gatka game into the all Chandigarh (U.T) schools, colleges, 
and universities sports calendars on the persistent appeals of CGA & GFI.
We are passionately longing from the States as well as Central Government 
to award due gradations of Gatka game certificates at par with 
the certificates of other games.
